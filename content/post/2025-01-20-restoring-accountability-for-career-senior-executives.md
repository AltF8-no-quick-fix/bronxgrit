## Presidential Action: Restoring Accountability for Career Senior Executives - A Deep Dive

This memorandum, issued on January 20, 2025, outlines a sweeping plan to restructure accountability within the Senior Executive Service (SES) of the US Federal Government.  While framed as a measure to improve efficiency and alignment with presidential priorities, it raises significant concerns regarding potential negative impacts on the civil service and the broader functioning of government.

**Analysis of the Memorandum's Claims:**

The memorandum rests on the constitutional principle of the President's authority to ensure the faithful execution of laws. It correctly cites *Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau* to support the President's power to remove subordinates. However, the memorandum's application of this principle is where the complexities arise.

**Positive Implications (as presented by the memorandum):**

* **Increased Accountability:** The memorandum aims to enhance accountability by strengthening performance evaluations, re-aligning SES member assignments with presidential priorities, and empowering agency heads to remove underperforming or disloyal officials.  This could theoretically lead to a more efficient and responsive government.
* **Alignment with Presidential Agenda:** Reassignments and performance plans directly tied to the President's agenda ensure that the SES actively supports the administration's policies.  This could lead to faster implementation of key initiatives.
* **Strengthened Chain of Command:** The emphasis on the President's authority over the SES reinforces a clear chain of command, potentially improving decision-making speed and clarity.

**Negative Implications and Counterarguments:**

* **Politicization of the Civil Service:** The most significant concern is the potential for extreme politicization of the SES.  The directives to reassign SES members based on alignment with the President's agenda, to replace ERB and PRB members with non-career officials, and the threat of removal for non-compliance create a chilling effect on independent judgment and expertise within the civil service.  This undermines the merit-based system, potentially leading to the appointment of less qualified individuals based on political loyalty rather than merit.
* **Erosion of Expertise and Institutional Knowledge:**  The frequent turnover and potential for removal of experienced SES officials could lead to a significant loss of institutional knowledge and expertise.  This could negatively impact the long-term effectiveness and stability of government agencies.
* **Reduced Morale and Recruitment Difficulties:**  The atmosphere of fear and uncertainty created by this memorandum could severely damage morale among SES officials, potentially leading to resignations and making it difficult to attract top talent to federal service in the future.  This could create a brain drain from the government.
* **Legal Challenges:** The memorandum's broad authority to remove SES officials could face legal challenges, particularly if removals are perceived as politically motivated or violate due process protections.
* **Lack of Transparency and Due Process:** While the memorandum mentions procedural requirements of section 3395 of title 5, US Code, it lacks detail on how due process will be ensured during performance evaluations and potential removals. This lack of transparency raises concerns about fairness and potential abuse of power.


**Long-Term Impact and Data Considerations:**

The long-term impact will depend heavily on the implementation of this memorandum.  If implemented strictly, it could lead to a significantly altered federal bureaucracy, characterized by political loyalty over expertise and a potentially less effective and less stable government.  Conversely, if implemented more moderately, some of the positive aspects, such as improved performance evaluations, could be realized without the severe negative consequences.

To assess the long-term impact, data on the following would be crucial:

* **SES turnover rates:**  A significant increase in turnover would indicate a negative impact on morale and institutional knowledge.
* **Agency performance metrics:**  Changes in agency efficiency and effectiveness should be tracked to evaluate the impact of the reforms.
* **Public perception of government effectiveness:**  Surveys and other measures of public trust in government

## Beyond the Headlines: A Critical Look

This memorandum outlines a Presidential plan to "restore accountability" for Career Senior Executives (SES) within the federal government.  The analysis below considers both positive and negative implications, acknowledging diverse perspectives.

**Positive Implications (from the Presidential perspective):**

* **Increased Executive Control:** The memorandum aims to strengthen the President's authority over the executive branch.  By emphasizing the President's power to remove SES officials and restructuring boards to include more non-career appointees, the administration seeks to ensure alignment with its policy agenda.  This is seen as crucial for efficient execution of the President's vision.
* **Improved Performance & Efficiency:**  The plan intends to improve SES performance through revised performance plans, reassignments based on skill alignment, and stricter performance evaluations.  This could lead to greater efficiency and effectiveness in government operations.
* **Enhanced Accountability:**  The emphasis on accountability aims to address potential issues such as unauthorized disclosures, violations of constitutional rights, and inefficient work practices.  This could bolster public trust in the government.
* **Policy Implementation:** By directly influencing SES assignments and performance reviews, the administration seeks to ensure seamless implementation of its policies and priorities.

**Negative Implications (from various perspectives):**

* **Politicization of the Civil Service:** Critics might argue that the actions proposed significantly politicize the civil service.  The emphasis on loyalty to the President over adherence to professional standards could lead to the removal of competent officials who disagree with the administration's policies.  This could harm institutional knowledge and expertise within the agencies.  The restructuring of ERBs and Performance Review Boards to include a majority of non-career officials reinforces this concern.
* **Erosion of Meritocracy:**  The focus on loyalty and alignment with the administration's agenda could undermine the merit-based system that traditionally governs the SES.  Competent officials might be replaced based on political considerations rather than their qualifications and performance.
* **Retaliation and Suppression of Dissent:**

## What This Means for You:  A Personal Perspective

As {impacted_person}, this Presidential memorandum significantly impacts my life, family, job, and community in several ways, with both potential benefits and drawbacks, and risks of abuse.

**Potential Benefits:**

* **Improved efficiency and effectiveness of government services:**  If the new accountability measures lead to more competent and dedicated SES officials, I might see improvements in the delivery of government services that affect me directly (e.g., environmental protection, public health, infrastructure projects).
* **Stronger policy implementation:**  If the focus on policy priorities is successful, it could result in more consistent and effective implementation of laws and programs relevant to my community and personal life.
* **Reduced waste and mismanagement:**  Accountability measures could potentially curb instances of waste and mismanagement within government agencies, which could lead to more efficient use of taxpayer dollars.
* **Enhanced public trust in government:**  If the changes demonstrably improve government performance, it could rebuild public trust in the executive branch.


**Potential Drawbacks:**

* **Job insecurity for SES officials:**  The memorandum explicitly states that SES officials serve at the pleasure of the President. This creates a climate of uncertainty and potential job loss for individuals in the SES. This could have ripple effects on my community, potentially leading to a loss of experience and expertise that may be difficult to replace.
* **Potential for political interference:**  The reconfiguration of Executive Resources Boards (ERBs) and Performance Review Boards (PRBs) with

MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES  



SUBJECT:       Restoring Accountability for Career Senior



Executives 



Career Senior Executive Service (SES) officials are charged to “ensure that the executive management of the Government of the United States is responsive to the needs, policies, and goals of the Nation and otherwise is of the highest quality,” as required by section 3131 of title 5, United States Code.  SES officials have enormous influence over the functioning of the Federal Government, and thus the well-being of hundreds of millions of Americans.  



As the Constitution makes clear, and as the Supreme Court of the United States has reaffirmed, “the ‘executive Power’ — all of it — is ‘vested in a President,’ who must ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.’”  Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 U.S. 197, 203 (2020).  “Because no single person could fulfill that responsibility alone, the Framers expected that the President would rely on subordinate officers for assistance.”  Id. at 203–04.  



The President’s power to remove subordinates is a core part of the Executive power vested by Article II of the Constitution and is necessary for the President to perform his duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”  Because SES officials wield significant governmental authority, they must serve at the pleasure of the President. 



Only that chain of responsibility ensures that SES officials are properly accountable to the President and the American people.  If career SES officials fail to faithfully fulfill their duties to advance the needs, policies, and goals of the United States, the President must be able to rectify the situation and ensure that the entire Executive Branch faithfully executes the law.  For instance, SES officials who engage in unauthorized disclosure of Executive Branch deliberations, violate the constitutional rights of Americans, refuse to implement policy priorities, or perform their duties inefficiently or negligently should be held accountable. 



The President must be able to trust that the Executive Branch will work together in service of the Nation.  My Administration will restore a “government of the people, by the people, for the people.”  Therefore: 



(a)  Within 30 days of the signing of this memorandum, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), shall issue SES Performance Plans that agencies must adopt;



(b)  Agency heads, who along with their senior staff manage career SES officials as one of their core functions, shall use all available authorities to reinvigorate the SES system and prioritize accountability;



(c)  Each agency head shall, as necessary and appropriate and consistent with the procedural requirements of section 3395 of title 5, United States Code, reassign agency SES members to ensure their knowledge, skills, abilities, and mission assignments are optimally aligned to implement my agenda;  



(d)  Each agency head should terminate its existing Executive Resources Board (ERB), institute a new or interim ERB, and assign senior noncareer officials to chair and serve on the board as a majority alongside career members;



(e)  Each agency head should terminate its existing Performance Review Board membership and re-constitute membership with individuals committed to full enforcement of SES performance evaluations that promote and assure an SES of the highest caliber; and



(f)  Any agency head who becomes aware of an SES official whose performance or continued occupancy of the position is inconsistent with either the principles reaffirmed in this Order or their duties to the Nation under section 3131 of title 5, United States Code, shall immediately take all appropriate actions, up to and including removal of that official, with the support of OPM and OMB.  Restoring an accountable government workforce is a top priority of my Administration.

Okay, folks, buckle up.  We've all heard about the "deep state" and unelected bureaucrats thwarting the will of the people. Well, guess what?  Action is being *taken*. Big action.  

Today, a memo went out from the top – straight from the President's desk – and it's all about bringing ACCOUNTABILITY back to the career Senior Executive Service (SES).  These are the folks in the upper echelons of government agencies, the ones with *serious* influence.  And let's be honest, sometimes that influence hasn't been used in the best interests of, well, *us*.

The memo makes it crystal clear: the President is the boss.  Article II of the Constitution, people! The executive power rests with the President, and that includes holding subordinates accountable.  If SES officials aren't on board with
