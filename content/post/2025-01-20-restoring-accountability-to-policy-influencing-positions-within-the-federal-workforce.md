## The Great Federal Workforce Shakeup: An Analysis of the January 20, 2025 Executive Order

This executive order, ostensibly aimed at "Restoring Accountability to Policy-Influencing Positions Within the Federal Workforce," represents a significant shift in the relationship between the executive branch and the federal civil service.  By reinstating and amending Executive Order 13957 (creating Schedule F), it seeks to significantly alter the protections afforded to a large segment of federal employees.  Let's break down the implications:

**The Core Action: Reviving and Rebranding Schedule F**

The heart of this order is the resurrection of Schedule F, a controversial classification system introduced in 2020.  This system designates certain policy-influencing positions as "excepted service," meaning they are largely exempt from the civil service protections afforded to most federal employees.  These protections include robust due process rights in disciplinary actions and more stringent requirements for termination.

The renaming of Schedule F to "Schedule Policy/Career" is purely cosmetic; the fundamental change remains.  The order makes several key amendments to the original Schedule F, including:

* **Broadening the Scope:**  The amendments expand the criteria for inclusion in Schedule Policy/Career, potentially encompassing a wider range of positions.  The vague language ("duties that the Director otherwise indicates may be appropriate") leaves significant discretion to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director.
* **Weakening Existing Protections:**  The order removes certain procedural safeguards, streamlining the process for removing employees.  The insertion of "competitive service and the" before "adverse action procedures" suggests a potential weakening of existing protections.
* **Direct Presidential Oversight:**  The amendments increase presidential influence over the process, requiring the OPM Director to "recommend that the President" take specific actions.
* **Clarifying (or Restricting?) Political Neutrality:**  The addition of Section 6(b) explicitly states that employees are not required to support the President's policies personally, but they *are* required to faithfully implement them. This creates a potentially ambiguous line between legitimate dissent and grounds for dismissal.

**Long-Term Impacts and Consequences:**

This executive order has the potential to reshape the federal workforce for years to come.  The consequences are multifaceted:

* **Increased Political Influence:**  The order's stated aim is to increase accountability, but the effect could be a significant increase in political influence over the civil service.  The ability to more easily remove employees who disagree with administration policies could chill dissent and create a more homogenous workforce.
* **Erosion of Merit-Based System:**  The potential for increased political influence undermines the merit-based principles that underpin the civil service.  This could lead to less qualified individuals being appointed to key positions, based on political loyalty rather than expertise.
* **Legal Challenges:**  The order is almost certain to face legal challenges.  Unions and employee advocacy groups will likely argue that it violates the principles of due process and the merit system, potentially leading to lengthy and costly litigation.
* **Decreased Morale and Retention:**  The uncertainty and potential for arbitrary dismissal could lead to decreased morale and increased turnover among federal employees.  This could negatively impact the effectiveness and efficiency of government operations.
* **Impact on Policy Implementation:**  While the order aims to ensure faithful policy implementation, it could backfire.  A climate of fear and political pressure might lead to less effective policy implementation due to a lack of critical feedback and independent analysis.


**Data Considerations:**

The order cites statistics indicating low supervisor confidence in removing underperforming or insubordinate employees (41% and 26%, respectively).  While these statistics highlight a potential problem, the order doesn't provide context or methodology.  Further investigation is needed to determine the validity and significance of these figures.  The long-term impact on

## Beyond the Headlines: A Critical Look

This Executive Order (EO) aims to reinstate and amend Executive Order 13957 ("Creating Schedule F"), which sought to create a new excepted service schedule for federal employees in policy-influencing roles.  The critique will analyze its strengths and weaknesses:

**Strengths:**

* **Direct and Decisive:** The EO is clear in its intent to strengthen accountability within the federal workforce, particularly for those in policy-influencing positions. It directly reinstates a previous order and makes specific amendments, leaving little room for ambiguity.
* **Justification Provided:** The preamble provides a rationale for the EO, citing low supervisor confidence in removing underperforming or misbehaving employees and documented instances of career employees undermining executive leadership.  The statistics presented, while needing sourcing, add weight to the argument.
* **Specific Amendments:**  The amendments to EO 13957 are detailed, outlining precisely how the original order will be modified. This reduces potential for misinterpretation and ensures a more targeted approach.  The inclusion of a section addressing political neutrality, while potentially controversial, adds clarity to expectations.
* **Revocation of Conflicting Orders:**  The revocation of EO 14003 ("Protecting the Federal Workforce") demonstrates a clear intent to reverse previous policies perceived as hindering accountability.
* **Procedural Considerations:**  The EO includes sections addressing conforming regulatory changes, guidance for additional positions, and general provisions limiting potential legal challenges.  This shows an attempt to create a legally sound and practically feasible plan.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Lack of Sourcing:** The EO claims only 41% of supervisors are confident in removing employees for misconduct and 26% for poor performance.  These statistics lack sourcing and should be included for greater credibility.  Similarly, the assertion of "numerous and well-documented cases" of employee resistance requires supporting evidence.
* **Potential for Abuse:** The broad scope of the amended "Schedule Policy/Career" and

## What This Means for You:  A Personal Perspective

Okay, let's break down this Executive Order and analyze its potential impacts from various perspectives. I'll role-play different "impacted persons" to explore the range of effects.

**Core of the Executive Order:**

This EO essentially revives and modifies "Schedule F" (renamed "Schedule Policy/Career"), a Trump-era order that was rescinded by President Biden.  The key change is that it makes it *much* easier to hire and, crucially, *fire* a significant number of federal employees in "policy-influencing" positions. These positions are currently in the competitive service, meaning they have strong job protections based on merit and are insulated from political pressure.  Schedule Policy/Career moves them to the "excepted service," significantly weakening those protections.  The stated goal is to increase accountability and ensure that employees are carrying out the President's agenda. The order explicitly mentions that failure to "faithfully implement administration policies" is grounds for dismissal.

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 3301, 3302, and 7511 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:



            Section 1.  Purpose.  Article II of the United States Constitution vests the President with the sole and exclusive authority over the executive branch, including the authority to manage the Federal workforce to ensure effective execution of Federal law.  A critical aspect of this executive function is the responsibility to maintain professionalism and accountability within the civil service.  This accountability is sorely lacking today.  Only 41 percent of civil service supervisors are confident that they can remove an employee who engaged in insubordination or serious misconduct.  Even fewer supervisors –- 26 percent — are confident that they can remove an employee for poor performance.



Accountability is essential for all Federal employees, but it is especially important for those who are in policy-influencing positions.  These personnel are entrusted to shape and implement actions that have a significant impact on all Americans.  Any power they have is delegated by the President, and they must be accountable to the President, who is the only member of the executive branch, other than the Vice President, elected and directly accountable to the American people.  In recent years, however, there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career Federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership.  Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.



Sec. 2.  Reinstatement of Prior Administration Policy.  Executive Order 13957 of October 21, 2020 (Creating Schedule F in the Excepted Service), is hereby immediately reinstated with full force and effect, subject to the amendments described in section 3 of this order; provided that the date of this order shall be treated as the date of Executive Order 13957.



Sec. 3.  Amendments to Prior Administration Policy.  Executive Order 13957 is amended as follows:

(c)  in section 4(a)(i), replace the word “Positions” with the words “Career positions” in the final paragraph;



(d)  in section 4(b)(i), add the text “providing for the application of Civil Service Rule 6.3(a) to Schedule Policy/Career positions and” after the words “as appropriate”;



(e)  in section 5:



(i)   insert the words “recommend that the President” immediately after the words “petition the Director to” in subsection (a)(i);



(ii)  insert the following text at the end of subsection (c):



“(vi)  directly or indirectly supervising employees in Schedule Policy/Career positions; or



(vii)  duties that the Director otherwise indicates may be appropriate for inclusion in Schedule Policy/Career.”; and



(iii)  amend subsection (d) to read “The Director shall promptly recommend to the President which positions should be placed in Schedule Policy/Career.”;



(f)  in section 6:



(i)   designate the existing text as new subsection“(a)”;



(ii)  insert a new subsection (b) that reads:“(b)  Employees in or applicants for Schedule Policy/Career positions are not required to personally or politically support the current President or the policies of the current administration. They are required to faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability, consistent with their constitutional oath and the vesting of executive authority solely in the President.  Failure to do so is grounds for dismissal.”



Sec. 4.  Conforming Regulatory Changes.  The Director of the Office of Personnel Management (Director) shall promptly amend the Civil Service Regulations to rescind all changes made by the final rule of April 9, 2024, “Upholding Civil Service Protections and Merit System Principles,” 89 Fed. Reg. 24982, that impede the purposes of or would otherwise affect the implementation of Executive Order 13957.  Until such rescissions are effectuated (including the resolution of any judicial review), 5 CFR part 302, subpart F, 5 CFR 210.102(b)(3), and 5 CFR 210.102(b)(4) shall be held inoperative and without effect.



Sec. 5.  Additional Positions for Consideration.  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Director shall, after consultation with the Executive Office of the President, issue guidance about additional categories of positions that executive departments and agencies should consider recommending for Schedule Policy/Career.

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or



(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.



(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

##  The President's Power Play:  Reining in the Bureaucracy (and Why It Matters)

Okay, folks, buckle up, because things just got *interesting* in the world of federal government.  President [President's Last Name] just dropped a major Executive Order shaking up the way things work in Washington.  And it's all about accountability – or rather, the *lack* thereof, and how to fix it.

The gist?  The President isn't happy with how some federal employees have been handling their jobs.  Apparently, there's been a lot of, shall we say, *resistance* to the administration's policies from within the ranks.  Think foot-dragging, undermining, and generally not playing ball.

The order itself is pretty dense legal jargon (you can find the whole thing [link to official document]), but here's the lowdown in plain English:
