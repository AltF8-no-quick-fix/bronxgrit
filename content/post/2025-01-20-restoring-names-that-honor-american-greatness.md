##  Executive Order: "Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness" - A Critical Analysis

This executive order, issued on January 20, 2025, aims to rename geographical features to reflect a particular interpretation of American history and national identity.  While presented as a celebration of American heroes, the order raises several significant concerns regarding its legality, impact, and underlying ideology.

**Key Provisions and Analysis:**

* **Section 1: Purpose and Policy:** This section sets the tone, emphasizing the promotion of a specific narrative of American heritage focusing on "visionary and patriotic Americans." This inherently subjective definition opens the door to bias and the exclusion of diverse perspectives.

* **Section 2: Appointments to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names:** This section reveals an attempt to influence the Board's composition and decision-making process.  The directive to "consider replacing" existing appointees suggests potential political interference, undermining the Board's independence and expertise.

* **Section 3: Renaming of Mount McKinley:** This section orders the reinstatement of "Mount McKinley," reversing the 2015 change to "Denali." The justification focuses on McKinley's role in the Spanish-American War and economic policies, neglecting the significance of the name "Denali" to the indigenous population of Alaska. This action disregards the principle of respecting indigenous place names and cultural heritage, potentially leading to conflict and resentment.

* **Section 4: Gulf of America:** This section proposes renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the "Gulf of America." The justification emphasizes the Gulf's economic importance to the United States, overlooking its shared history and significance to Mexico and other bordering nations. This unilateral action could strain international relations and be perceived as an act of cultural appropriation.

* **Section 5: Additional Action:** This section anticipates further renaming initiatives, suggesting a broader campaign to reshape the American landscape according to the administration's vision.  This raises concerns about a potential wave of politically motivated name changes.

* **Section 6: General Provisions:** This section includes standard legal disclaimers, limiting liability for the government.


**Long-Term Impact and Consequences:**

The long-term consequences of this executive order are potentially far-reaching and multifaceted:

* **Political Polarization:** The order is likely to exacerbate existing political divisions.  Supporters will see it as a restoration of traditional American values, while opponents will view it as an erasure of indigenous history and a politically motivated rewriting of the past.

* **Legal Challenges:** The order's potential for legal challenges is high.  Indigenous groups and potentially even international entities could challenge the renaming decisions on grounds of cultural insensitivity, lack of consultation, and potential violations of treaty obligations.  The legal battles could be protracted and costly.

* **International Relations:** The renaming of the Gulf of Mexico could damage relations with Mexico and other countries with a stake in the region.  It could be perceived as a hostile act, undermining cooperation on issues such as environmental protection and resource management.

* **Erosion of Trust in Government Institutions:** The blatant attempt to influence the Board on Geographic Names could erode public trust in the objectivity and impartiality of government institutions.

* **Cost:** The process of renaming geographical features, updating maps, and revising official documents will incur significant costs for federal agencies.


**Data Considerations:**

While the executive order cites economic data regarding the Gulf of Mexico, it lacks a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of the renaming initiatives.  There is no data presented on the potential economic or social costs associated with the backlash and legal challenges that might arise.  The absence of a thorough assessment of the potential negative impacts weakens the order's justification.

## Beyond the Headlines: A Critical Look

Here's a critique and analysis of the provided Executive Order, "Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness":

**Critique:**

*   **Highly Partisan and Divisive:** The order is transparently political, framed in the language of "American greatness" which is often associated with a specific political ideology. It directly attacks the actions of a previous administration (President Obama) and uses loaded terms like "affront" to describe a decision made by that administration. This approach is likely to alienate a significant portion of the population.
*   **Ignoring Indigenous Perspectives:** While Section 3(c) mentions working with Alaska Native entities, the primary focus is on restoring the McKinley name, a move that actively disregards the long-standing Indigenous name for the mountain (Denali). This is a major oversight and a sign of disrespect to the original inhabitants of the land. Similarly, the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico completely ignores any historical or cultural significance the name may hold for other nations bordering the Gulf.
*   **Arbitrary and Unjustified Name Changes:** The justification for renaming the Gulf of Mexico is weak and overly focused on economic benefits.  The connection to "American greatness" feels forced and nationalistic.  Renaming a major geographical feature like a gulf is a significant action with international implications, and the order doesn't address those implications.
*   **Overreach of Executive Power:** While the President has authority over the Board on Geographic Names, unilaterally renaming a major body of water like the Gulf of Mexico is arguably an overreach.  Such a change would typically involve extensive consultation, not just with domestic stakeholders but also with international bodies and neighboring countries (Mexico and Cuba).
*   **Lack of Consultation:** The order emphasizes speed (actions within 7, 30 days) and gives the impression of minimal consultation with relevant experts, stakeholders, and the public. Major geographical name changes should be the result of careful deliberation, not a

## What This Means for You:  A Personal Perspective

Let's break down this Executive Order and its potential impacts from several perspectives.

**1. {impacted_person} = An Alaskan Native (particularly one from a group that uses the name "Denali")**

*   **Impact on Life/Family/Community:**  This is a mixed bag.  The order explicitly states that Denali National Park and Preserve will *retain* its name. This is a significant win, as "Denali" is the traditional Athabaskan name for the mountain and holds deep cultural and spiritual significance.  The retention of the park's name acknowledges this heritage. However, the forced renaming of the mountain *itself* back to McKinley is a direct slap in the face. It disregards the decades-long effort by Alaskan Natives to have the traditional name officially recognized, and it prioritizes a relatively recent (in the grand scheme of history) president over millennia of indigenous presence and connection to the land.  It feels like a token gesture – "we'll let you keep the park's name, but the mountain belongs to *our* history now."  This could cause significant resentment and a feeling of being culturally erased. It will likely rekindle protests and legal challenges.
*   **Benefits:**  The order does mandate the Secretary of the Interior to "work with Alaska Native entities and state and local organizations to adopt names for landmarks to honor the history and culture of the Alaskan people." This *could* be a

						January 20, 2025					
				

			
					
	




By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:



Section 1.  Purpose and Policy.  It is in the national interest to promote the extraordinary heritage of our Nation and ensure future generations of American citizens celebrate the legacy of our American heroes.  The naming of our national treasures, including breathtaking natural wonders and historic works of art, should honor the contributions of visionary and patriotic Americans in our Nation’s rich past. 



Sec. 2.  Appointments to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.  (a)  Within seven days of the date of this order, each agency head with authority to appoint members to the Board on Geographic Names (Board) pursuant to 43 U.S.C. 364a, shall review their respective appointees and consider replacing those appointees in accordance with applicable law.



(b)  The Secretary of the Interior shall review and consider additional appointments to the Board to assist in fulfilling all aspects of this order, subject to all applicable laws.



(c)  With respect to all applications for naming and renaming submitted to the newly constituted Board, the Board shall advance the policy established in section 1 of this order to honor the contributions of visionary and patriotic Americans and may update its principles, policies, and procedures as needed to achieve this policy.



(d)  Where Congressional action is required to establish a renaming in public law, following Board approval on renaming, the Board shall provide guidance to all relevant Federal agencies to use the Board-approved name in the interim in federal documents and achieve consistency across the federal government.



Sec. 3.  Renaming of Mount McKinley.  (a)  President William McKinley, the 25th President of the United States, heroically led our Nation to victory in the Spanish-American War.  Under his leadership, the United States enjoyed rapid economic growth and prosperity, including an expansion of territorial gains for the Nation.  President McKinley championed tariffs to protect U.S. manufacturing, boost domestic production, and drive U.S. industrialization and global reach to new heights.  He was tragically assassinated in an attack on our Nation’s values and our success, and he should be honored for his steadfast commitment to American greatness.



In 1917, the country officially honored President McKinley through the naming of North America’s highest peak.  Yet after nearly a century, President Obama’s administration, in 2015, stripped the McKinley name from federal nomenclature, an affront to President McKinley’s life, his achievements, and his sacrifice.



This order honors President McKinley for giving his life for our great Nation and dutifully recognizes his historic legacy of protecting America’s interests and generating enormous wealth for all Americans.



(b)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall, consistent with 43 U.S.C. 364 through 364f, reinstate the name “Mount McKinley.”  The Secretary shall subsequently update the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) to reflect the renaming and reinstatement of Mount McKinley.  The national park area surrounding Mount McKinley shall retain the name Denali National Park and Preserve.



(c)  The Secretary of the Interior shall work with Alaska Native entities and state and local organizations to adopt names for landmarks to honor the history and culture of the Alaskan people.



Sec. 4.  Gulf of America.  (a)  The area formerly known as the Gulf of Mexico has long been an integral asset to our once burgeoning Nation and has remained an indelible part of America.  The Gulf was a crucial artery for America’s early trade and global commerce.  It is the largest gulf in the world, and the United States coastline along this remarkable body of water spans over 1,700 miles and contains nearly 160 million acres.  Its natural resources and wildlife remain central to America’s economy today.  The bountiful geology of this basin has made it one of the most prodigious oil and gas regions in the world, providing roughly 14% of our Nation’s crude-oil production and an abundance of natural gas, and consistently driving new and innovative technologies that have allowed us to tap into some of the deepest and richest oil reservoirs in the world.  The Gulf is also home to vibrant American fisheries teeming with snapper, shrimp, grouper, stone crab, and other species, and it is recognized as one of the most productive fisheries in the world, with the second largest volume of commercial fishing landings by region in the Nation, contributing millions of dollars to local American economies.  The Gulf is also a favorite destination for American tourism and recreation activities.  Further, the Gulf is a vital region for the multi-billion-dollar U.S. maritime industry, providing some of the largest and most impressive ports in the world.  The Gulf will continue to play a pivotal role in shaping America’s future and the global economy, and in recognition of this flourishing economic resource and its critical importance to our Nation’s economy and its people, I am directing that it officially be renamed the Gulf of America.



(b)  As such, within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall, consistent with 43 U.S.C. 364 through 364f, take all appropriate actions to rename as the “Gulf of America” the U.S. Continental Shelf area bounded on the northeast, north, and northwest by the States of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida and extending to the seaward boundary with Mexico and Cuba in the area formerly named as the Gulf of Mexico.  The Secretary shall subsequently update the GNIS to reflect the renaming of the Gulf and remove all references to the Gulf of Mexico from the GNIS, consistent with applicable law.  The Board shall provide guidance to ensure all federal references to the Gulf of America, including on agency maps, contracts, and other documents and communications shall reflect its renaming.



Sec. 5.  Additional Action.  The Secretary of Interior may solicit public and intergovernmental input regarding additional patriots to honor, particularly in light of America’s semiquincentennial celebration, and shall recommend action to me, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy.



Sec. 6.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:



(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or



(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.



(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.



(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

**President's Decree: Rewriting the American Story, One Name at a Time**

Hey everyone,

Just got wind of a pretty big presidential action that's going to shake up some things, and I wanted to give you the lowdown.  This isn't some run-of-the-mill decree; it's a full-on effort to honor what this country stands for, according to the new administration.

The gist of it is restoring names that supposedly reflect American greatness, specifically those names that got "tampered" with. The executive order, issued on January 20, 2025, essentially directs a renaming of some key landmarks and bodies of water.  It's a pretty big undertaking, touching on everything from mountaintops to seas.

**The Big Changes:**

* **Mount McKinley Back to McKinley:**  The order aims to reinstate the name "Mount McKinley" for the highest peak in North America, reversing a
