##  A Presidential Memo, a Lumbee Milestone, and a Whole Lotta Red Tape (Blog Post)

So, a pretty big thing happened on January 23rd, 2025 (at least, in this hypothetical scenario).  President [President's Name] issued a memorandum directing the Secretary of the Interior to figure out how to grant full federal recognition to the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina.  For those unfamiliar, the Lumbee are a large tribe (over 55,000 members!), historically residing in North Carolina, and they've been fighting for this recognition for a *long* time.

Think of it like this:  the Lumbee have had state recognition since 1885, and even got a nod from President Eisenhower in 1956 with the Lumbee Act.  However, that Act was a bit of a mixed bag – it acknowledged their existence but didn't give them the same federal benefits and protections as other federally recognized tribes.  It's like getting a participation trophy but not the actual prize.  Not cool.

The House of Representatives has repeatedly tried to pass the Lumbee Fairness Act to fix this, and in 2024, it passed with a pretty strong majority (311-96!).  But, alas, the Senate didn't take it up before the end of the session.  Hence, the Presidential memo – a direct intervention to get the ball rolling.

**The Memo's Plan:**

The memo gives the Secretary of the Interior 90 days to come up with a plan.  This plan needs to explore all possible avenues:

* **Legislative Action:**  Basically, pushing for the Lumbee Fairness Act (or a similar bill) to pass Congress.  This is the most straightforward route, but also the most politically challenging.
* **Judicial Action:**  Going to court to argue for recognition based on existing laws and precedents.  This is a longer, more uncertain path.
* **Bureaucratic Route:**  Using the existing federal process for tribal recognition (25 C.F.R. Part 83). This is a notoriously lengthy and complex process.

**Long-Term Impacts:  A Potential Game Changer**

If successful, federal recognition would be HUGE for the Lumbee.  It would open doors to:

* **Federal Funding:**  Access to vital resources for education, healthcare, housing, and economic development.
* **Self-Governance:**  Greater control over their own affairs and resources.
* **Legal Protections:**  Enhanced legal standing to protect their lands, culture, and heritage.

**The Critics' Corner (Because Every Good Story Needs One):**

Some critics might argue that this recognition could set a precedent, potentially opening the floodgates for other groups seeking federal recognition.  Others might raise concerns about the potential cost to taxpayers.  These are legitimate concerns that need to be addressed transparently and thoughtfully.  The process needs to be fair, not just for the Lumbee but for all involved.

**The Bottom Line:**

This presidential memo represents a significant step towards justice for the Lumbee Tribe.  It's a long road ahead, filled with potential hurdles, but it's a road worth traveling.  The next 90 days will be crucial in determining the path forward and the ultimate success of this important effort.  Let's hope the wheels of bureaucracy don't grind too slowly this time!


## Beyond the Headlines: A Critical Look

Okay, let's analyze this Presidential Memorandum regarding the Federal Recognition of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina.

**Overall Assessment:**

This memorandum signals a significant shift in the US government's approach to the Lumbee Tribe. While the Lumbee have been recognized by the state of North Carolina and acknowledged by the federal government in a limited way since 1956, this memo directs the Secretary of the Interior to actively pursue full federal recognition, including associated benefits. This is a positive development for the tribe, but the memorandum also acknowledges that the process may be complex and require exploring various legal pathways.

**Strengths and Positive Implications:**

*   **Clear Policy Statement:** The memorandum explicitly states the policy of the United States is to support full federal recognition of the Lumbee Tribe, leaving no room for ambiguity. This is a strong signal of intent.
*   **Acknowledgement of History and Significance:** The memo acknowledges the Lumbee's long history, their size, and their cultural significance, which can help build support for the initiative.
*   **Directive for Action:** The memo doesn't just express support; it directs the Secretary of the Interior to develop a plan of action within a specific timeframe (90 days). This increases the likelihood of tangible progress.
*   **Exploration of Multiple Pathways:** The memo instructs the Secretary to consider various legal pathways, including legislation, judicial action, and the existing BIA administrative process (25 C.F.R. Part 83). This flexibility is crucial because each pathway has its own challenges and potential benefits.
*   **Consultation with the Tribe:** Mandating consultation with Lumbee leadership is essential for ensuring the plan is aligned with the tribe's goals and priorities.
*   **Addresses a Long-Standing Grievance:** The Lumbee have sought full federal recognition for decades. This action addresses a long-standing issue and attempts to rectify what many perceive as an injustice.

## What This Means for You:  A Personal Perspective

Several scenarios are possible depending on who the impacted person is:

**Scenario 1: A member of the Lumbee Tribe:**

* **Life/Family/Community:** This memorandum is potentially life-changing. Full federal recognition would bring access to healthcare, education, and housing assistance programs specifically designed for Native Americans.  It could strengthen cultural preservation efforts and provide a stronger sense of identity and belonging within the Lumbee community.  Economic opportunities could arise through tribal businesses and federal grants.
* **Job:**  Job training programs and preference in federal employment could become available, leading to better career prospects.
* **Benefits:**  Access to the Indian Health Service, Bureau of Indian Education grants and scholarships, and housing assistance are significant benefits.  The tribe could also pursue economic development opportunities like casinos (if allowed by state law) which could create jobs and revenue for the community.
* **Drawbacks:** The process outlined in the memorandum still requires further action from the Secretary of the Interior and could involve navigating complex legal and bureaucratic processes. There's no guarantee of a swift outcome. Increased federal oversight might also be perceived as a loss of some tribal autonomy by some members.
* **Risks of abuse/unfairness:** There’s a risk that the increased funding and resources could be mismanaged by tribal leadership.  There's also the potential for increased scrutiny and prejudice from outside communities who may misunderstand the implications of federal recognition.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR



SUBJECT:       Federal Recognition of the Lumbee Tribe of North



Carolina



Section 1.  Purpose and Policy.  The Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, known as the People of the Dark Water, have a long and storied history.  The tribe’s members were descendants of several tribal nations from the Algonquian, Iroquoian, and Siouan language families, including the Hatteras, the Tuscarora, and the Cheraw.  The waters of the Lumbee River and lands that surround it have protected and provided for the Lumbee people for centuries despite war, disease, and many other perils.



In 1885, the State of North Carolina recognized the Lumbee people as an Indian tribe.  1885 N.C. Sess. Laws 92.  In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Lumbee Act (Public Law 84-570, 70 Stat. 254), which recognized the Lumbee as the Lumbee Indians of North Carolina but denied Lumbee Indians Federal benefits associated with such recognition.  Today, according to the State of North Carolina, the Lumbee Tribe consists of more than 55,000 members, making it the largest tribe east of the Mississippi River and the ninth-largest tribe in the Nation.



In 2024, the United States House of Representatives passed, by a vote of 311-96, the Lumbee Fairness Act (H.R. 1101), which would grant the Lumbee Tribe full Federal recognition, but this legislation was not considered by the United States Senate before the end of the 118th Congress.  Similar legislation has passed the House of Representatives several times.



Considering the Lumbee Tribe’s historical and modern significance, it is the policy of the United States to support the full Federal recognition, including the authority to receive full Federal benefits, of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina.

## Okay, So the President *Finally* Did Something About the Lumbee... (Kinda)

Alright, folks, grab your sweet tea and pull up a chair, because we need to talk about the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina. And, more specifically, about what President [Fictional President's Last Name] *just* did (or, more accurately, *didn't quite* do) about them.

**The Backstory (in a Nutshell, Because Seriously, It's Complicated)**

The Lumbee, or "People of the Dark Water," have been around for a *long* time. We're talking centuries. They're a mix of different tribal groups (Algonquian, Iroquoian, and Siouan – think Hatteras, Tuscarora, and Cheraw) who came together in the swamps and rivers of what's now North Carolina. North Carolina recognized them as a tribe way back in
