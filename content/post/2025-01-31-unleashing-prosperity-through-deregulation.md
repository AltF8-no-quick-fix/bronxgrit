## Detailed, Comprehensive Analysis of "Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation" Executive Order

This analysis provides a detailed examination of the Executive Order "Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation," issued on January 31, 2025. It covers the order's key provisions, potential impacts, and considers different perspectives on its implications.

**I. Executive Order Overview**

The core of the Executive Order revolves around a significant reduction in federal regulations, aiming to stimulate economic growth and improve the quality of life for citizens. The key elements include:

*   **"Ten-for-One" Rule:** For every new regulation proposed, an agency must identify and eliminate at least ten existing regulations. This is the cornerstone of the deregulation effort.
*   **Regulatory Cost Cap:** For Fiscal Year 2025, the total incremental cost of new regulations must be significantly less than zero, meaning overall regulatory costs must decrease. This is to be determined by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
*   **OMB Oversight:** The OMB Director is given significant authority to oversee the regulatory process, including:
    *   Providing guidance to agencies on cost measurement, offsetting regulations, and waivers.
    *   Approving additions and removals from the Unified Regulatory Agenda.
    *   Setting agency-specific cost allowances for new regulations.
*   **Definition of "Regulation":** The order broadly defines "regulation" to include a wide range of agency actions, including rules, memoranda, guidance documents, and interagency agreements. Certain categories are excluded, such as those related to national security, agency management, or those exempted by the OMB Director.
*   **Reinstatement of Prior OMB Guidance:** The order revokes the current OMB Circular A-4 and reinstates the 2003 version, along with the 2018 Memorandum of Agreement between the Treasury and OMB regarding tax regulations.

**II. Detailed Analysis of Key Sections**

*   **Section 1 (Purpose):** This section lays out the rationale for the order, emphasizing the negative impacts of complex federal regulations on economic growth, innovation, and global competitiveness. It frames deregulation as a means to achieve economic prosperity, national security, and a higher quality of life. The "ten-for-one" rule is presented as a mechanism to control regulatory costs.
*   **Section 3 (Regulatory Cap for Fiscal Year 2025):** This section establishes the core of the order's immediate impact. The "ten-for-one" rule is mandated for all agencies, and the Director is given the authority to ensure that the overall cost of new regulations is significantly less than zero. This section sets the tone for the administration's approach to regulatory policy.
*   **Section 4 (Annual Regulatory Cost Submissions to the Office of Management and Budget):** This section outlines the long-term framework for regulatory oversight. Agencies must provide detailed cost-benefit analyses of new and repealed regulations. The OMB Director gains significant control over the Unified Regulatory Agenda, ensuring that all regulations are approved and that agencies adhere to cost allowances. This section establishes a centralized control over the regulatory process.
*   **Section 5 (Definition):** This section defines the scope of the order, specifying what constitutes a "regulation" and what is excluded. The broad definition suggests the order's wide-ranging applicability. The exclusions, particularly those related to national security and those exempted by the Director, create potential loopholes and areas of discretion.
*   **Section 6 (Implementation):** This section assigns responsibility for implementing the order to the OMB Director, granting them the authority to issue guidance, standardize cost estimations, and ensure compliance. The revocation of the current OMB Circular A-4 and reinstatement of the 2003 version is a significant move, likely reflecting a shift in the approach to regulatory analysis.



## Beyond the Headlines: A Critical Look

Okay, here's a critique and analysis of the Executive Order (EO), considering both positive and negative implications and various perspectives:

**Overall Aim and Underlying Philosophy**

The EO's stated aim is to stimulate economic growth and enhance American competitiveness by drastically reducing the regulatory burden on businesses and individuals.  The underlying philosophy is a strong belief in deregulation as a primary driver of prosperity.  It's a classic conservative, market-oriented approach that prioritizes reducing government intervention in the economy. The order assumes a direct inverse correlation between regulation and economic prosperity.

**Critique and Analysis**

Here's a breakdown of the key sections, with critiques and considerations:

*   **Section 1 (Purpose):**
    *   **Positive:** The statement correctly identifies that regulations can be complex and costly.  Reducing unnecessary complexity and streamlining processes *can* benefit businesses, especially small businesses that lack the resources of large corporations.
    *   **Negative:** The language is highly charged and hyperbolic ("ever-expanding morass," "massive costs"). It presents a one-sided view of regulation, failing to acknowledge any potential benefits (e.g., environmental protection, worker safety, consumer protection, financial stability).  The "10-for-1" rule is arbitrary and lacks any economic or scientific basis. It prioritizes quantity over quality and could lead to the removal of essential safeguards. The broad definition of what is to be considered a "regulation" is also concerning.
    *   **Perspective:** Businesses burdened by regulations will likely support this. Environmental groups, labor unions, consumer advocacy groups, and public health organizations will strongly oppose it.

*   **Section 2 (Policy):**
    *   **Positive:**  Fiscal responsibility and prudent expenditure of funds are generally good principles.
    *   **Negative:**  The EO equates *all* regulation with unnecessary burden, which is a flawed premise.  It frames the issue solely in

## What This Means for You:  A Personal Perspective

Let's consider how this Executive Order on deregulation might affect different types of people.  I'll analyze potential benefits, drawbacks, and risks of abuse for each.


**1.  Small Business Owner (e.g., Restaurant Owner):**

* **Benefits:**  Potentially significant reduction in regulatory burdens and compliance costs.  Fewer forms to fill out, less paperwork, potentially lower insurance costs if some regulations related to safety or employment are loosened.  This could free up time and resources to focus on business growth.

* **Drawbacks:**  Depending on the regulations removed, some protections for workers (e.g., safety regulations, minimum wage laws, environmental regulations) might be weakened. This could lead to increased operational costs in other areas (e.g., increased worker's compensation claims).  The order's focus on cost reduction might lead to a decrease in food safety inspections, impacting public health.

* **Risks of Abuse/Unfairness:**  The "10-for-1" rule could lead to the removal of important regulations without sufficient consideration of their impact, prioritizing cost savings over public safety or environmental protection.  The ambiguity in the definition of "regulation" allows for potential manipulation.  Smaller businesses may lack the resources to navigate the changes effectively compared to larger corporations.


**2.  Factory Worker:**

* **Benefits:**  Potentially more jobs due to increased business activity from deregulation.  However, this is speculative

UNLEASHING PROSPERITY THROUGH DEREGULATION



By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, as amended (31 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), and in order to promote prudent financial management and alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens, it is hereby ordered: 



Section 1.  Purpose.  The ever-expanding morass of complicated Federal regulation imposes massive costs on the lives of millions of Americans, creates a substantial restraint on our economic growth and ability to build and innovate, and hampers our global competitiveness.  Despite the magnitude of their impact, these measures are often difficult for the average person or business to understand, as they require synthesizing the collective meaning not just of formal regulations but also rules, memoranda, administrative orders, guidance documents, policy statements, and interagency agreements that are not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act, further increasing compliance costs and the risk of costs of non-compliance.  It is the policy of my Administration to significantly reduce the private expenditures required to comply with Federal regulations to secure America’s economic prosperity and national security and the highest possible quality of life for each citizen.  To that end, it is important that for each new regulation issued, at least 10 prior regulations be identified for elimination.  This practice is to ensure that the cost of planned regulations is responsibly managed and controlled through a rigorous regulatory budgeting process.



Sec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the executive branch to be prudent and financially responsible in the expenditure of funds, from both public and private sources, and to alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens placed on the American people. 



Sec. 3.  Regulatory Cap for Fiscal Year 2025.  (a)  Unless prohibited by law, whenever an executive department or agency (agency) publicly proposes for notice and comment or otherwise promulgates a new regulation, it shall identify at least 10 existing regulations to be repealed.



(b)  For fiscal year 2025, which is in progress, the heads of all agencies are directed to ensure that the total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, being finalized this year, shall be significantly less than zero, as determined by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (Director), unless otherwise required by law or instructions from the Director.



(c)  In furtherance of the requirement of subsection (a) of this section, any new incremental costs associated with new regulations shall, to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs associated with at least 10 prior regulations.



(d)  The Director shall provide the heads of agencies with guidance on the implementation of this section.  Such guidance shall address, among other things, processes for standardizing the measurement and estimation of regulatory costs; standards for determining what qualifies as new and offsetting regulations; standards for determining the costs of existing regulations that are considered for elimination; processes for accounting for costs in different fiscal years; methods to oversee the issuance of rules with costs offset by savings at different times or different agencies; and emergencies and other circumstances that might justify individual waivers of the requirements of this section.  The Director shall consider phasing in and updating these requirements.



Sec. 4.  Annual Regulatory Cost Submissions to the Office of Management and Budget.  Beginning with the Regulatory Plans, as required under Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (Regulatory Planning and Review), as amended, or any successor order for fiscal year 2026, and for each fiscal year thereafter:



(a)  The head of each agency shall identify on an aggregated basis, for regulations that increase incremental cost, the offsetting regulations described in section 3(c) of this order, and provide the agency’s best approximation of the total costs or savings associated with each new regulation or repealed regulation.



(b)  Each regulation approved by the Director during the Presidential budget process shall be included in the Unified Regulatory Agenda required under Executive Order 12866, as amended, or any successor order.  Unless otherwise required by law, no regulation shall be added to or removed from the Unified Regulatory Agenda without the approval of the Director.  To accomplish the purposes of this order, the Director may also require additions to the Unified Regulatory Agenda and Regulatory Plan.



(c)  Unless otherwise required by law, no regulation shall be issued by an agency if it was not included in the most recent version or update of the published Unified Regulatory Agenda as required under Executive Order 12866, as amended, or any successor order, unless the issuance of such regulation was approved in advance in writing by the Director.



(d)  During the Presidential budget process, the Director shall identify to agencies a total amount of incremental costs that will be allowed for each agency in issuing new regulations and repealing regulations for each fiscal year after fiscal year 2025.  No regulations exceeding the agency’s total incremental cost allowance will be permitted in that fiscal year, unless required by law or approved in writing by the Director.  The total incremental cost allowance may allow an increase or require a reduction in total regulatory cost.



(e)  The Director shall provide the heads of agencies with guidance on the implementation of the requirements in this section.



Sec. 5.  Definition.  For purposes of this order, the term “regulation” or “rule” means an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or to describe the procedure or practice requirements of an agency, including, without limitation, regulations, rules, memoranda, administrative orders, guidance documents, policy statements, and interagency agreements, regardless of whether the same were enacted through the processes in the Administrative Procedure Act, but does not include:



(a)  regulations issued with respect to a military, national security, homeland security, foreign affairs, or immigration-related function of the United States;



(b)  regulations related to agency organization, management, or personnel; or



(c)  any other specific regulation or category of regulations exempted by the Director, who shall exempt those regulations or categories of regulations that impose minimal costs or burdens on the private sector or that are requested to be exempted by the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff or the Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy.



Sec. 6.  Implementation.  (a)  The Director is charged with implementing this order, including by providing agencies with updated guidance on implementing the ten-for-one rule described in section 3(a) of this order, including processes for identifying regulations for elimination, determining what constitutes, generally and specifically, a “rule” or “regulation” for purposes of this order, estimating and standardizing regulatory costs, and ensuring compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable laws.  



(b)  The Director shall revoke OMB Circular No. A-4 of November 9, 2023 (Regulatory Analysis), and all accompanying appendices, guidelines, and documents, and shall reinstate the prior version of Circular A-4, issued on September 17, 2003; and 



(c)  The Secretary of the Treasury and the Director shall reinstate the Memorandum of Agreement between the Department of the Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget of April 11, 2018, regarding review of tax regulations under Executive Order 12866.



Sec. 7.  Severability.  If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.



Sec. 8.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:  



(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or 



(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.  



(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.  



(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

## Ten Regulations Gotta Go! (For Every New One, That Is)

Whoa, big news out of the White House today!  The President just signed a HUGE executive order about deregulation – and it's causing quite a stir. Basically, it's a "ten-for-one" deal on regulations. For every new regulation the government wants to put in place, they have to get rid of *ten* old ones.  Think of it like spring cleaning for the legal code!

Now, I know what you're thinking: "Regulations? Snoozefest."  But hold on, because this actually affects all of us. Regulations are basically rules the government sets for businesses and individuals.  Too many, and it can stifle innovation and economic growth (imagine trying to start a lemonade stand with a thousand permits!). Too few, and things can get… well, chaotic (think food safety nightmares!).

This executive order aims to slash the "regulatory burden" – the
