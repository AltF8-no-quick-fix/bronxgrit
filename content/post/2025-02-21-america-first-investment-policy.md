## Analysis of "America First Investment Policy" Presidential Action

This presidential memorandum outlines a significant shift in US investment policy, prioritizing national security and economic competitiveness, particularly against perceived threats from China (PRC). While aiming to attract investment from allies, it establishes a complex framework with potentially far-reaching consequences.

**Long-Term Impacts and Consequences:**

**1. Reshaping Global Investment Flows:**

* **Reduced Chinese Investment:** The policy explicitly targets PRC-affiliated investments in critical sectors, potentially leading to a significant decline in Chinese capital flowing into the US.  Data from Rhodium Group shows Chinese FDI in the US peaked at $46 billion in 2016 but plummeted to $800 million in 2021 due to escalating tensions. This policy could further solidify this downward trend.
* **Increased Allied Investment:** The "fast-track" process for allied investments aims to attract capital from friendly nations.  However, the effectiveness depends on the clarity and objectivity of the "objective standards" mentioned.  If successful, it could lead to increased investment from countries like Japan, South Korea, and European nations, partially offsetting the decline in Chinese investment.  Success will be measurable by tracking FDI inflows from these nations in subsequent years.
* **Shifting Global Supply Chains:** Restricting Chinese investment in strategic sectors could accelerate the ongoing decoupling of US and Chinese economies and contribute to the reshaping of global supply chains.  Companies might relocate manufacturing and R&D activities to avoid scrutiny, potentially impacting global trade patterns and potentially increasing costs for US consumers.

**2. Impact on US Innovation and Technological Development:**

* **Potential for "Brain Drain":**  Restricting foreign talent access, especially in AI, could hinder US innovation by limiting the pool of skilled workers.  This could be measured by tracking visa applications and immigration patterns for highly skilled workers in relevant sectors.
* **Stimulating Domestic Innovation:** By prioritizing domestic investment and restricting access to US technology for adversaries, the policy aims to boost American innovation.  However, the success depends on the effectiveness of government support for R&D and the ability of US companies to compete globally without access to certain foreign markets and capital.  Indicators like patent filings, R&D spending, and the growth of emerging tech sectors will be crucial to assess the impact.

**3. Economic and Market Volatility:**

* **Impact on US Capital Markets:**  Restricting US investments in Chinese companies, particularly in publicly traded securities, could impact US investors and financial markets.  The potential delisting of Chinese companies from US exchanges and the termination of the tax treaty could create market uncertainty and volatility.  Stock market performance, investor sentiment, and capital flows will be key indicators.
* **Increased Litigation and Regulatory Burden:** The implementation of new rules and regulations will likely lead to increased legal challenges and regulatory burdens for businesses, particularly those operating in sensitive sectors.  This could increase compliance costs and create uncertainty for investors.

**4. Geopolitical Implications:**

* **Escalating US-China Tensions:** The policy's explicit focus on countering China's influence could further escalate tensions between the two countries, potentially leading to retaliatory measures from China and impacting broader bilateral relations.  Diplomatic interactions, trade disputes, and military posturing will be key indicators.
* **Strengthening Alliances:** The focus on attracting investment from allies could strengthen US relationships with key partners, creating a more unified front against perceived threats.  This can be assessed by analyzing trade agreements, joint military exercises, and diplomatic initiatives.

**5. Unintended Consequences:**

* **Overreach and Inefficiency:**  The broad scope of the policy and the emphasis on executive action could lead to overreach and inefficiency in implementation.  The vague definition of "foreign adversaries" and the reliance on "all necessary legal instruments" raise concerns about potential abuse of power and lack of transparency.

## Beyond the Headlines: A Critical Look

This "America First Investment Policy" memorandum outlines a comprehensive strategy to reshape U.S. investment policy with a strong emphasis on national security and economic competitiveness, particularly in relation to China and other perceived "foreign adversaries." Here's a breakdown of its strengths, weaknesses, and overall analysis:

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Articulation of Concerns:** The memorandum clearly identifies the perceived threats posed by foreign (primarily Chinese) investment, including the acquisition of critical technologies, intellectual property, infrastructure, and the use of U.S. capital to support military development. This provides a strong rationale for the policy changes.
*   **Focus on National Security:** The policy prioritizes national security as a guiding principle, arguing that economic security is national security. This aligns with a broad consensus that protecting critical infrastructure and sensitive technologies is paramount.
*   **Targeted Approach:** The policy distinguishes between passive investments (which are largely welcomed) and those with potential for control or influence, particularly from "foreign adversaries." This allows for a nuanced approach rather than a blanket ban on all foreign investment.
*   **Streamlining and Efficiency:** The memorandum proposes streamlining environmental reviews and reducing bureaucratic "mitigation" agreements, suggesting a desire to make the U.S. a more attractive investment destination for allies and partners.
*   **Comprehensive Strategy:** The policy utilizes a range of tools, including CFIUS, sanctions, and tax policy, to address the identified risks. It also proposes a review of outbound investments, indicating a willingness to take a proactive approach.
*   **Specific Directives:** The memorandum provides clear directives to various government agencies, outlining their responsibilities for implementing the policy.
*   **Emphasis on Allies and Partners:** The policy explicitly welcomes investment from allies and partners, and creates a "fast track" for such investment, which could strengthen relationships and provide a strategic advantage.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Potential for Overreach and Unintended Consequences:** The

## What This Means for You:  A Personal Perspective

Okay, I am a **small business owner** in the United States, specifically in the **agricultural sector**, and I'll analyze the "America First Investment Policy" from my perspective.

**Impact on My Life, Family, Job, and Community:**

*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Protection from Foreign Competitors:** The policy's focus on restricting investment from countries like China could potentially shield my business from unfair competition. If PRC-affiliated entities are limited in buying up farmland or investing in agricultural technology, it could create a more level playing field for domestic farmers and businesses like mine.
    *   **Increased Investment from Allies:** The "fast-track" process for investment from allied countries could open new avenues for capital. This could lead to opportunities for expansion, adopting new technologies, or improving infrastructure on my farm.
    *   **Reduced Environmental Review Times:** The expedited environmental reviews for investments over $1 billion could, indirectly, lead to faster infrastructure improvements.
    *   **Focus on American Growth:** The President's stated goal to make the US a more attractive place for investment could boost the overall economy and create a more stable environment for my business.
*   **Drawbacks:**
    *   **Increased Scrutiny:** The policy's emphasis on national security might lead to more government oversight and scrutiny of my business, especially if I deal with advanced technologies or have foreign investors.
    *   **Potential for Trade Ret

SUBJECT:       America First Investment Policy  By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:          Section 1.  Principles and Objectives.  America’s investment policy is critical to our national and economic security.  Welcoming foreign investment and strengthening the United States’ world-leading private and public capital markets will be a key part of America’s Golden Age.  The United States has the world’s most attractive assets, in technology and across our economy, and we will make it easier for our overseas allies to support United States jobs, United States innovators, and United States economic growth with their capital.          Investment by United States allies and partners can create hundreds of thousands of jobs and significant wealth for the United States.  Our Nation is committed to maintaining the strong, open investment environment that benefits our economy and our people, while enhancing our ability to protect the United States from new and evolving threats that can accompany foreign investment.          Investment at all costs is not always in the national interest, however.  Certain foreign adversaries, including the People’s Republic of China (PRC), systematically direct and facilitate investment in United States companies and assets to obtain cutting-edge technologies, intellectual property, and leverage in strategic industries.  The PRC pursues these strategies in diverse ways, both visible and concealed, and often through partner companies or investment funds in third countries.           Economic security is national security.  The PRC does not allow United States companies to take over their critical infrastructure, and the United States should not allow the PRC to take over United States critical infrastructure.  PRC-affiliated investors are targeting the crown jewels of United States technology, food supplies, farmland, minerals, natural resources, ports, and shipping terminals.          The PRC is also increasingly exploiting United States capital to develop and modernize its military, intelligence, and other security apparatuses, which poses significant risk to the United States homeland and Armed Forces of the United States around the world.  Related actions include the development and deployment of dual-use technologies, weapons of mass destruction, advanced conventional weapons, and malicious cyber‑enabled actions against the United States and its people.  Through its national Military-Civil Fusion strategy, the PRC increases the size of its military-industrial complex by compelling civilian Chinese companies and research institutions to support its military and intelligence activities.          Those Chinese companies also raise capital by:  selling to American investors securities that trade on American and foreign public exchanges; lobbying United States index providers and funds to include these securities in market offerings; and engaging in other acts to ensure access to United States capital and accompanying intangible benefits.  In this way, the PRC exploits United States investors to finance and advance the development and modernization of its military.          Sec. 2.  Policy.  (a)  It is the policy of the United States to preserve an open investment environment to help ensure that artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies of the future are built, created, and grown right here in the United States.  Investment in our economy from our allies and partners, some of whom have tremendous sovereign wealth funds, supports the national interest.  My Administration will make the United States the world’s greatest destination for investment dollars, to the benefit of all of us.           (b)  Yet for investment in United States businesses involved in critical technology, critical infrastructure, personal data, and other sensitive areas, restrictions on foreign investors’ access to United States assets will ease in proportion to their verifiable distance and independence from the predatory investment and technology-acquisition practices of the PRC and other foreign adversaries or threat actors.          (c)  The United States will create an expedited “fast-track” process, based on objective standards, to facilitate greater investment from specified allied and partner sources in United States businesses involved with United States advanced technology and other important areas.  This process will allow for increased foreign investment subject to appropriate security provisions, including requirements that the specified foreign investors avoid partnering with United States foreign adversaries.            (d)  My Administration will also expedite environmental reviews for any investment over $1 billion in the United States.          (e)  The United States will reduce the exploitation of public and private sector capital, technology, and technical knowledge by foreign adversaries such as the PRC.  The United States will establish new rules to stop United States companies and investors from investing in industries that advance the PRC’s national Military-Civil Fusion strategy and stop PRC-affiliated persons from buying up critical American businesses and assets, allowing only those investments that serve American interests.          (f)  The United States will use all necessary legal instruments, including the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), to restrict PRC-affiliated persons from investing in United States technology, critical infrastructure, healthcare, agriculture, energy, raw materials, or other strategic sectors.  My Administration will protect United States farmland and real estate near sensitive facilities.  It will also seek, including in consultation with the Congress, to strengthen CFIUS authority over “greenfield” investments, to restrict foreign adversary access to United States talent and operations in sensitive technologies (especially artificial intelligence), and to expand the remit of “emerging and foundational” technologies addressable by CFIUS.          (g)  To reduce uncertainty for investors, reduce administrative burden, and increase Government efficiency, my Administration will cease the use of overly bureaucratic, complex, and open-ended “mitigation” agreements for United States investments from foreign adversary countries.  In general, mitigation agreements should consist of concrete actions that companies can complete within a specific time, rather than perpetual and expensive compliance obligations.  More administrative resources, in turn, will be directed toward facilitating investments from key partner countries.          (h)  The United States will continue to welcome and encourage passive investments from all foreign persons.  These include non-controlling stakes and shares with no voting, board, or other governance rights and that do not confer any managerial influence, substantive decisionmaking, or non-public access to technologies or technical information, products, or services.  This will allow our cutting-edge businesses to continue to benefit from foreign investment capital, while ensuring protection of our national security.          (i)  The United States will also use all necessary legal instruments to further deter United States persons from investing in the PRC’s military-industrial sector.  These may include the imposition of sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) through the blocking of assets or through other actions, including actions pursuant to Executive Order 13959 of November 12, 2020 (Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Communist Chinese Military Companies), as amended by Executive Order 13974 of January 13, 2021 (Amending Executive Order 13959 — Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Communist Chinese Military Companies) and Executive Order 14032 of June 3, 2021 (Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Certain Companies of the People’s Republic of China), and actions pursuant to Executive Order 14105 of August 9, 2023 (Addressing United States Investments in Certain National Security Technologies and Products in Countries of Concern).  Executive Order 14105 is under review by my Administration, pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (America First Trade Policy), to examine whether it includes sufficient controls to address national security threats.          (j)  This review will build on measures taken under my authority in 2020 and 2021 and consider new or expanded restrictions on United States outbound investment in the PRC in sectors such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum, biotechnology, hypersonics, aerospace, advanced manufacturing, directed energy, and other areas implicated by the PRC’s national Military-Civil Fusion strategy.  Covered sectors should be reviewed and updated regularly, including by the Office of Science and Technology Policy.  As part of the review, my Administration will consider applying restrictions on investment types including private equity, venture capital, greenfield investments, corporate expansions, and investments in publicly traded securities, from sources including pension funds, university endowments, and other limited-partner investors.  It is past time for American universities to stop supporting foreign adversaries with their investment decisions, much as they should stop granting university access to supporters of terrorism.          (k)  To further reduce incentives for United States persons to invest in our foreign adversaries, we will review whether to suspend or terminate the 1984 United States-The People’s Republic of China Income Tax Convention.  That tax treaty, along with the PRC’s admission to the World Trade Organization and the related undertaking by the United States to accord unconditional Most Favored Nation treatment to goods and services of the PRC, led to the deindustrialization of the United States and the technological modernization of the PRC military.  We will seek to reverse both those trends.  United States investors will invest in the future of America, not the future of the PRC.          (l)  To protect the savings of United States investors and channel them into American growth and prosperity, my Administration will also:          (i)    determine if adequate financial auditing standards are upheld for companies covered by the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act;          (ii)   review the variable interest entity and subsidiary structures used by foreign-adversary companies to trade on United States exchanges, which limit the ownership rights and protections for United States investors, as well as allegations of fraudulent behavior by these companies; and          (iii)  restore the highest fiduciary standards as required by the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974, seeking to ensure that foreign adversary companies are ineligible for pension plan contributions.          Sec. 3.  Implementation.  The policy set forth in section 2 of this memorandum shall be implemented, to the extent permitted by law and available appropriations, and subject to internal programmatic and budgetary processes, as follows:          (a)  With respect to sections 2(a) through 2(k) of this memorandum, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of other executive departments and agencies (agencies) as deemed appropriate by the Secretary of the Treasury, and with respect to the authorities of CFIUS in coordination with the members thereof, shall take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, to support all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, and other statutes to carry out the purposes of this memorandum.          (b)  With respect to section 2(d) of this memorandum, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the heads of other agencies as appropriate, shall carry out the purposes of this memorandum.          (c)  With respect to section 2(l)(i) of this memorandum, the Secretary of the Treasury shall engage as appropriate with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; with respect to section 2(l)(ii) of this memorandum, the Attorney General, in coordination with the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall provide a written recommendation on the risk posed to United States investors based on the auditability, corporate oversight, and evidence of criminal or civil fraudulent behavior for all foreign adversary companies currently listed on domestic exchanges; and with respect to section 2(l)(iii) of this memorandum, the Secretary of Labor shall publish updated fiduciary standards under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 for investments in public market securities of foreign adversary companies.          Sec. 4.  Definition.  For purposes of this memorandum, the term “foreign adversaries” includes the PRC, including the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Macau Special Administrative Region; the Republic of Cuba; the Islamic Republic of Iran; the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea; the Russian Federation; and the regime of Venezuelan politician Nicolás Maduro.          Sec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:                  (i.) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or                  (ii.) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.         (b)  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.          (c)  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
